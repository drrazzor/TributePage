			<p id="tribute-info"> Sardar Patel lived an extra-ordinary life in extra-ordinary times.
				For his iron will and nerves of steel, he earned the title Iron Man of India. For his astute leadership and compassion, his people lovingly called him Sardar. The geographic entity we know as India, bears the imprint of the genius and statesmanship of this one man. It is the most lasting legacy Patel left for the future. 'History' said Nehru speaking about Sardar Patel, would 'call him the builder and consolidator of the new India.'

				Sardar Patel's life was shaped by major events that took place around him just as much as he gave shape to major events. This Timeline provides a brief glimpse into the extraordinary life of Sardar Patel marking important events and landmarks in his momentous journey.
